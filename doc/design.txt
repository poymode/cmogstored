object relationships
--------------------

1:1 relationship between mog_cfg and mog_svc, we'll support multiple
mog_svc if they don't conflict.

There's only one mog_queue instance for now, shared by any number of
mog_svc instances.  Theoretically, there can be any number of mog_queue
objects, but having one means the fairest distribution in the worst-case
scenarios (at the cost of optimal performance in the best-case scenario)



mog_cfg[0] -- mog_svc[0] --- mog_mgmt[N]
                 |       \-- mog_http[N]
                 |
                 |
                /
               /         ___ mog_accept[N]
    mog_queue[0]--------<___ mog_accept[N]
               \
                \
                 |
                 |
                 |
mog_cfg[1] -- mog_svc[1] --- mog_mgmt[M]
                         \-- mog_http[M]
