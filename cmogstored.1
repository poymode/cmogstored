SIGQUIT - gracefully shutdown the server
SIGUSR2 - upgrade executable on the fly
.SH UPGRADING
Upgrading cmogstored on-the-fly is possible since version 1.2.0.
The procedure is close to the one used by nginx users: send SIGUSR2
followed by SIGQUIT to the old process.  Use of SIGWINCH and SIGHUP
are currently not supported (but may be in the future).
Procedures for the nginx upgrade are documented here:
http://wiki.nginx.org/CommandLine#Upgrading_To_a_New_Binary_On_The_Fly
