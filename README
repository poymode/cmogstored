cmogstored - alternative mogstored implementation for MogileFS
--------------------------------------------------------------

cmogstored is an alternative implementation of the "mogstored" storage
component of MogileFS.  cmogstored is implemented in C and does not use
Perl at runtime.  cmogstored is the only component you need to install
on a MogileFS storage node.

Features
========

* low memory footprint, more memory for file system caches
* multithreaded design[1] keeps queues in rotational disks busy
* epoll/kqueue used to cheaply maintain persistent connections
* supports checksumming features in MogileFS::Server 2.60+
* easily installable on modern GNU/Linux and FreeBSD without Perl
* supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections and pipelining
* supports chunked and partial (Content-Range) HTTP/1.1 PUT requests
* supports partial GET requests
* may reject PUTs based on Content-MD5 header/trailer verification
* graceful shutdown via SIGQUIT will not terminate active requests
* extensive test suite, code coverage and Valgrind-tested

Getting Started
===============

See the INSTALL document for installation and runtime requirements.

cmogstored aims to be mostly command-line and configuration-file
compatible with the Perl mogstored.

cmogstored does not support spawning lighttpd/Apache instances like its
Perl counterpart.

In other cases, you can simply replace "mogstored" with "cmogstored"
in your init scripts and use the same config file.
