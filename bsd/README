We depend on headers common to *BSDs but not standardized in POSIX.
GNU/Linux distributions sometimes package these headers, but they
are sometimes out-of-date and missing macros we rely on.

All headers in this (bsd/) directory are under their respective
(3-clause BSD) license and not covered by the GPL that applies
to the rest of cmogstored.
